# Our MATH4939 Text Book

Creating our own textbook for MATH 4939

This is the repository for our new textbook for MATH 4939. 

This textbook does not replace
the 'official' textbook by Ken Kleinman and Nicholas J. Horton (2014) *SAS and R, Data Management
Statistical Analysis, and Graphics,* 2nd ed. CRC Press. It supplements it by 
exploring issues in the interpretation of statistical results. Also, some statistical
techniques are investigated in greater depth.

Most sections are R scripts written in R Markdown. These scripts are in this repository.

The html files generated by the scripts, along with other files, are periodically
uploaded to 

http://blackwell.math.yorku.ca/MATH4939/2016/OurTextBook/

The table of contents for the book is generated with [index.R](index.R).

To contribute to this book, 

1. clone this repository -- or pull if already cloned
2. add an R script in R Markdown format
3. add a link to the script and to the html file it will generate in index.R
4. stage, commit and push the result

Within a few days, the results will appear [on Blackwell](http://blackwell.math.yorku.ca/MATH4939/2016/OurTextBook/).
